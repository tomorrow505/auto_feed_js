<b>About BLUEBIRD-HD.ORG</b><a name="#72" id="72"></a>
<br>
<br>
The BLUEBIRD-HD.ORG project is a Russian-language private P2P tracker created by connoisseurs and for connoisseurs of high-quality audio and video content. This project is not commercial and all materials published by us are in the public domain. All releases published on our portal are distinguished by their quality and compliance with Blu-ray specifications and encoding profiles for correct playback on software and hardware players.

<br>
<b>What makes the project exist?</b><a name="#73" id="73"></a>
<br>
<br>
The project exists at the expense of enthusiasts, <a class="altlink" href="donate.php">Your donations for development</a>, as well as advertising banners.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is a torrent (bittorrent)?</b><a name="#10" id="10"></a>
<br>
<br>
Bittorrent is a protocol designed for sharing files. In fact, it is a peer-to-peer protocol, when each user connects to another directly to receive or transmit pieces of information. To work with this protocol, we recommend using µTorrent, BitComet or Azureus. For a more detailed description, see <a class="altlink" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">here</a>

<br>
<b>I was sent an invitation to register and I registered an account, but I did not receive a confirmation email or I still cannot log in!</b><a name="#13" id="13">< /a>
<br>
<br>
Look for the letter in 'spam'. Please note that if the confirmation e-mail was not received the first time, then it probably will not be received the second time either. Try to use another e-mail address, the most efficient services are gmail.com, ukr.net.<br><br>
When the tracker switches to invite mode, your account must be checked and confirmed by the administrator (may take up to a day). Please read carefully and follow the registration rules, invitations will NOT be returned and compensated.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What are the benefits/responsibility of inviting someone?</b><a name="#108" id="108"></a>
<br>
<br>
Inviting someone by you will "pay off" a hundredfold - now, if the user you invited is respectable and seeding, you will receive 15% bonuses for his seeding. The invitee himself does not lose bonuses at the same time and the accrual occurs in accordance with the general rules. If you have invited a cheater/violator of the rules - when you disable it, you will automatically receive a warning. User classes "VIP" and "Ghost" do not rise back to these classes after the warning expires. Please be selective about invitations. Do not invite previously disabled for violating the Rules.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>I forgot my account name or password! Could you send them to me?</b><a name="#14" id="14"></a>
<br>
<br>
Please use the <a class="altlink" href="recover.php">password recovery form</a> to have your registration details emailed to you.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Could you make changes to my account?</b><a name="#15" id="15"></a>
<br>
<br>
We do not rename accounts, as well as make changes to personal information. Please choose your details carefully when registering. An exception can be only in the case of a donation equivalent to "+100 GB up" without crediting the distributed to the profile (because constantly wasting time and manually making changes in the MySQL database "for beautiful eyes" - there is not the slightest desire). Changing an email to a new one can only be done if you have access to the current one (no exceptions).
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Help! Can't login!</b><a name="#74" id="74"></a>
<br>
<br>
This problem often occurs in the case of disabled or incorrectly stored (as a result of browser errors) Cookies, delete them and try to log in again.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>My IP address is dynamic. Is it critical?</b><a name="#75" id="75"></a>
<br>
<br>
No. It's not critical. All you have to do is make sure you are logged in (logged in) with your current IP address when starting a new torrent session (starting a new download/upload). After that, even if your IP changes during the session, the download or distribution will continue, and the statistics will be updated automatically.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What about privacy? Why is my IP displayed on the details page?</b><a name="#76" id="76"></a>
<br>
<br>
Only you and moderators can see your IP and email. Regular users cannot see this information. The tracker administration does not distribute this information.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why does it say I can't connect? (In the Port column, my port is red, what should I do?)</b><a name="#77" id="77"></a>
<br>
<br>
The tracker has detected that you have a firewall (firewall) or NAT, and you can not accept connections. This means that other participants will not be able to connect to you, only you to them.
To solve this problem, open the ports used for incoming connections (same as your client's settings) in the firewall and/or configure your NAT server. (Refer to the documentation for your router or the manufacturer's forum).
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why can't my friends register?</b><a name="#78" id="78"></a>
<br>
<br>
This means that the limit of users has been exceeded, or there are appropriate restrictions for violators of the Rules. Accounts inactive for more than 120 days are automatically deleted, so let's try again later. (We don't have a seat reservation system, or a queue, don't ask us about it!)
At the moment, the number of visitors is limited to 25,000 places on the tracker, as a rule, when this number of users is reached, free registration stops, but inactive accounts are regularly deleted. If you/your friends want to register, you need to visit the tracker regularly to check availability. Registration during regular time (excluding holidays, solemn events / events) - available by invitation / or free.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Invitation (invite).</b><a name="#106" id="106"></a>
<br>
<br>
In case of registration by invites, you can ask for an invite from previously registered participants (or in another way, which will be additionally reported by the Administration). For those who want to invite, do not create invitations for the future when registration is closed (they will be deleted when registration is opened by invite).
<br><br>
The sale of invites is strictly prohibited. When a trader is detected, the entire chain of invitees is disabled (with the trader in the first place), regardless of whether the user was invited for a fee or for free.
<br><br>
With regards to <b>"VIP invites": it is allowed</b> when one of your friends asks you to buy this lot (single cases are assumed when you help) and <b>categorically not allowed</b> when someone - or creates websites, telegram channels, he offers to buy an invite from him on the forums (usually at an inflated cost and without activating the VIP status), etc. "activity".

<b>How to download??</b><a name="#80" id="80"></a>
<br>
<br>
1. Install any of the recommended torrent clients.<br>

<br>2. Click on the title of the torrent you are interested in:<br>

<br>and specify the path where to save downloaded files:<br>

<br><br>
<br>
<b>Which torrent clients can I use on the tracker?</b><a name="#117" id="117"></a>
<br>
<br>
Those clients/their versions that:<br>
1) have not been modified before (and this does not necessarily mean that you have exactly "such" client / its version) and allow you to manipulate statistics aka "cheating");<br>
2) do not steal user data (for example, passkey) and correctly transfer statistics to the tracker.<br><br>
As of 09/05/2019 exactly <b>allowed</b>:
<br> • µTorrent 2.0.4 stable (not 21515), 2.2.1 stable, 3.0 stable, 3.1.2 stable, 3.1.3 stable, 3.2 beta, 3.3 stable, 3.4.0 – 3.5.5

<br> • Transmission on QNAP<br><br>
The rest of the torrent clients / their versions are mostly blocked (whether your client is included in the list, you can always find out by the message in the announcer: if yes, you are in lich, if not, you will not be able to connect to the distribution with a message about the need to change the client).
<br><br>
<b>NB</b> pre-logic model: "Some are forbidden, others are allowed", not <s>"All are forbidden, but only some are allowed".</s> But this is not accurate =) (question under discussion and the behavior can be changed to the second model, but the specified clients and their versions in the list above will be accepted for sure).
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can I increase my download speed?</b><a name="#81" id="81"></a>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Switch to a higher speed plan/change provider</b><br>
For the most part, the slow download speed primarily depends on the service provider to the worldwide Internet. If your speed is limited to TP 128 Kbps, then it's no wonder why the download process is slow - switch to a more expensive TP!<br>

<br>It is also very likely that your ISP limits the exchange of p2p traffic (otherwise - simply "shaping"). If so, try in your torrent client settings "encrypt connection protocol" For example in µTorrent: settings -&gt; configuration -&gt; Bittorrent-&gt; protocol encryption "Enable/Enabled" and also do not forget to set the permission to accept unencrypted connections (ibid.).<br>

<br><b>Don't pounce on new torrents</b><br>
Especially if you have a slow speed. Give it to download first of all to people with wide channels, who will then distribute it, including you. The best time to download is closer to the middle of a torrent stream, this is when the SLR reaches its climax and you can download at maximum speed. (However, in this case, you will not be able to distribute as long as if you downloaded this file from the very beginning. So you need to balance between these 2 criteria.<br>

<br><b>Set up your equipment for a normal connection</b><br>
As a rule, if before downloading torrent files, the download-upload speed was high, then with a sufficient number of seeds, the download speed will be high.<br>

<br><b>Wait a moment</b><br>
Other participants try to share first of all with those who distribute to them. When you first start downloading a new file, you have nothing to offer other members and they will ignore you. This will cause the speed to be quite slow at the beginning of the download, especially if not connected to any or very few seeders. Download speed should increase once you have a few pieces to give away.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What are these icons: <img src="pic/freedownload.gif">, <img src="pic/silver.gif">, <img src="pic/bronze.gif">, <img src="pic/coins.png">, <img src="pic/freecoins.png">, <img src="pic/diamond.png">, <img src="pic/mecenat.gif">, <img src="pic/buttons/lock.png">, <img src="pic/buttons/key.png">, <img src="pic/compl.png">?</b><a name ="#98" id="98"></a>
<br>
<br>
The <img src="pic/freedownload.gif"> icon means that the torrent is "free", that is, if you download it, you will only count the amount of downloaded information. Everything that you download on this torrent will not be recorded in global statistics, and everything that you give away will be counted. Such downloads are good for raising the rating.<br>
<br>The icon <img src="pic/silver.gif"> means that the distribution is "silver": 50% downloads and 100% distribution are taken into account.<br>
<br>The icon <img src="pic/bronze.gif"> means that the distribution is "bronze": 75% of downloads and 100% of distributions are taken into account.<br>
<br>The <img src="pic/diamond.png"> icon means that the distribution is "diamond": the amount of downloaded is not taken into account and 200% of distribution is taken into account (the amount of distribution you distribute is multiplied by 2). Such torrents do not cost "coins" and are the best for raising the rating<br>
<br><br>The icon <img src="pic/coins.png"> shows the "cost" for downloading a torrent, the currency is virtual. How it works: each torrent download up to 20 GB costs 25 coins, every next 2 GB + 2.5 coins. Information about the "cost" of each torrent and the balance of your coin balance is available near the link to download the torrent. Each of the already registered users and beginners - to the "account" one-time and automatically transferred 200 coins. Coins are withdrawn only 1 time per download - if, for example, a download failure occurs, the coins will NOT be withdrawn again. Accordingly, the <img src="pic/freecoins.png"> icon means that you will not be charged coins for downloading a torrent.
<br><br>! If you download from 2 different IPs, then don't be surprised why the torrent was downloaded 1 time, and the coins were debited twice.<br>
<br>!No need to mindlessly click on "Download torrent" coins in this case will be deducted from you at your own responsibility (or, more precisely, irresponsibility).<br>

<br>The system of "purchasing" torrents for coins does not apply to the "VIP" class and above.
<br>
<br> <img src="pic/mecenat.gif"> We do not impose participation in the acquisition of voiceovers and / or translations, as well as your participation in the initiation of any projects that need financial injection (for example, most new products are purchased with using the funds of users who have made donations - for which Thank you very much), but the wishes about paying attention to information about the start of such projects have been taken into account and now you can help by clicking on this icon that appears (active, in case of projects in need and disappears when not needed). As an encouragement to patrons for the distributions in which your funds were invested, as well as to level the re-distributions on other resources - the function of the order of downloading the distribution is implemented - i.e. torrent distribution with your financial help, although it will be available for download to everyone, but the project participants and the tracker team, VIP users will be the first to download it, the second - Extreme users, the third - the rest (the order in each individual case can be changed, in the example only a general trend is shown). This order will be only for distributions with financial participation of users, this innovation will NOT apply to other distributions.<br><br><br>
<center><b>!Such Projects are created exclusively by the Tracker Administration!</b>
<br>The <img src="pic/buttons/lock.png"> and <img src="pic/buttons/key.png"> icons mean that the giveaway is "closed" (or has been closed ever before, and is now "open" - in this case, "the key does not need to be spent; or the distribution is available to certain classes of users - which will be indicated in the distribution itself) and is available only to those users who have a "key" and / or to the corresponding classes of users. If you there is a "key" - you can spend it to gain access to the distribution with a "lock": 1 key will be debited and you will have permanent access to such a distribution If you do not have a "key" and there are no analogues on the tracker that are similar in category (by decision of the Administration, these may already be placed with less content) - then the distribution will be available to you in the same way, but later (in a few days / months / years, respectively, indicating the exact date / month and year / year; in the last two cases, "try your luck " on your own, to the questions: "and when exactly ..." - you risk getting a warning, especially annoying ones - ba n). <b>Such distributions (and their derivatives) are prohibited from being transferred, "assisted in distributing" anywhere (both RUnet and foreign segment).</b> This innovation is connected with the desire to interest users in the financial support of the tracker, as well as and the lack of desire to regularly / importunately remind of common truths: "We can not always buy everything at our own expense; the tracker needs to be maintained; novelties do not materialize out of thin air, etc. and will apply to unique and new releases that are completely, or " for them were purchased. You can buy "keys" through the <b>"Donations" section.</b> Unclaimed (never downloaded) distributions with the "Lock" will be removed from the tracker at the end of the "closed" period.<br ></center>

<br>
There are also auxiliary icons that show your status in the general list of torrents (near the date and time the torrent was downloaded), for example <img src="pic/compl.png">, value:<br><br>
SEEDING - green (torrent downloaded and seeded, you can leave if you wish);<br>
SEEDING - red (torrent downloaded and seeding, can't leave to avoid getting warning for 'Hit&amp;Run');<br>
LEECHING - orange (rocking);<br>
COMPLETED - gray (torrent downloaded and not seeded, no warning for 'Hit&amp;Run');<br>
COMPLETED - red (torrent downloaded and not seeded, you need to return to the distribution, so as not to get a warning for 'Hit&amp;Run').<br><br>
Auxiliary icons are cached and therefore take up to half an hour to update.<br>

<br>
Open *.torrent file. When your client asks where to save - select the path to existing files. The download will continue.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why do my downloads sometimes stop at 99%?</b><a name="#100" id="100"></a>
<br>
<br>
You have already downloaded quite a large number of parts, and the client is trying to find users who have parts that you have not downloaded, or downloaded with errors. Therefore, the download can sometimes stop at the moment when only a few percent are left to complete. Be patient a little, and soon (well, or not very much :) ) the client will finish downloading all the missing parts.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What does the message "a piece has failed an hash check" mean?</b><a name="#101" id="101"></a>
<br>
<br>
Torrent clients check the received data for integrity. When a part is uploaded with errors, it is automatically reloaded. It happens to almost everyone, so don't worry. Some clients have an option to automatically ignore users who send you parts with errors. If you want to stop accepting parts from this user in the future, you need to enable this feature in your client.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>The size of the torrent is 10GB. How could I download 11GB?</b><a name="#102" id="102"></a>
<br>
<br>
See previous paragraph. If your client received a part with errors, he will redownload it. Thus, the total amount downloaded can be more than the size of the torrent.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why can't I download anything at all, although I'm using a normal client?</b><a name="#104" id="104"></a>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are using one of the banned clients. If only specific versions of your client are banned, then you can update your client to the latest version (or vice versa "roll back" to an earlier one) and continue downloading again. If you are using a client, all versions of which are banned, then you will have to change the client, otherwise you will not be able to download anything from our tracker.

<b>Who can upload releases?</b><a name="#83" id="83"></a>
<br>
<br>
Users with the "Aloader" class and above have the right to distribute. You can also download a torrent by creating a proposal (similar to the design in existing distributions, otherwise it will be deleted) if it gets 20 votes.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can I help with distribution? How to continue seeding already downloaded material?</b><a name="#86" id="86"></a>
<br>
<br>
In case you want to continue seeding, but deleted the torrent file or task from the client, and if the file/folder was only moved and not renamed, then you need to download the torrent file from the distribution and specify as the location for saving the location of this file/folder. The client will perform a hash check and land on the seed.
If the file or folder has been renamed, then you need to rename it in accordance with the original distribution and carry out the manipulations indicated above.
If you want to help with a share and it seems to you that you have exactly the same file(s) as the sharer, then you first need to check their size. Go to the page with the distribution and check the size of the distribution, then check the size of your file (files) and if the sizes match byte for byte, then rename your file (files) according to the original distribution, download the torrent file for distribution, specify in client as a place to save the location of your files. The client will perform a hash check and land on the seed.

<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why are these respects needed?</b><a name="#90" id="90"></a>
<br>
<br>
Respects are used as an indicator of the activity and adequacy of the user. Also, for each respect - you get additional bonuses (which you can then change to add to the rating, invites, personal signature, etc.) As well as for anti-respects, the system provides for penalties.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is my rating?</b><a name="#92" id="92"></a>
<br>
<br>
Rating is the amount of information you gave divided by the amount downloaded. Your ratio is written at the top of the information panel, under your nickname.
It is important to distinguish between the overall rating (ratio) and the rating of each torrent you download or distribute. The overall rating is calculated from the total values ​​uploaded and distributed by your account from the moment you registered on the site. The individual rating of each torrent only takes into account the amount of uploaded/downloaded for a particular file (torrent).
Also 2 designations are possible instead of rating: "Inf.", it is an abbreviation of the word Infinity (infinity), and means that you downloaded 0 bytes, while distributing a non-zero value; and there may also be "---", which should be read as "not available", and means that you have not downloaded or uploaded anything.

<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is "Time Seed" rating?</b><a name="#114" id="114"></a>
<br>
<br>
This is a ranking that displays (when enabled) your total seeding time. This type of rating is cumulative. Example: on hand "a" your Time Seed rating is 2, and on hand "b" your Time Seed rating is 1, the seed rating in this case will be 1.5. The principle of work for calculating this rating is not presented in order to avoid cheating.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can I increase my rating?</b><a name="#93" id="93"></a>
<br>
<br>
Give the amount that you downloaded and the rating will increase. Use golden distributions - only distributed distributions are counted on them, and downloads are not counted. Or silver/bronze - only 50%/75% of the download counts. Pay special attention to the rating until you score 1 or more.
You can also make a donation or purchase a VIP account to raise or temporarily suspend the rating, or use bonus points (coins).
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is "My Bonus"? How to "earn" coins?</b><a name="#94" id="94"></a>
<br>
<br>
This is a unique tracker feature. "My bonus" is premium coins (points) that you get in the process of seeding (distributing) a torrent or for respect. You can exchange them for the corresponding lots in the bonus section.
"Earn" coins - You can: <br> <br>
1. Commenting on distributions (for each comment over 20 characters +25 coins, useless comments can be deleted, coins deducted, and the account for this violation is temporarily banned for "sobering up"); <br>
2. Getting likes from other users (5 coins for 1 like); <br>
3. Seeding previously downloaded releases. You can find out how and how much you can earn by seeding <a href="http://bluebird-hd.org/mybonus.php">in the accrual formula in the "Bonuses" section</a>

"Awards" is a system of counting and assigning a user a multi-level status for unique achievements.<br>

<br><img src="pic/status/toprespecteduser_level2.png"> - TOP User, issued for the number of respects from other users. Gradation - 10, 50, 100.<br>

<br><img src="pic/status/superseed_level3.png"> - TOP Seeder, assigned for the number of seeded torrents. Gradation - 10, 50, 100.<br>

<br><img src="pic/status/invitor_level3.png"> - TOP Inviter, issued for the number of invited users. Gradation - 10, 25, 50.<br>

<br><img src="pic/status/warned_level2.png"> - "Devil" is a reminder that you have already received a warning, if you do not plan to violate it again - do not pay attention to it (does not limit properties, available to your user class), but as soon as there are three of them, the system automatically tells you: "Goodbye". You can completely get rid of the record that you have a warning in the "Bonuses" section.<br>

<b>How not to get pred for Hit &amp; Run (when active)? And what are these icons <img src="pic/walk_prohibited.png">, <img src="pic/walk_possible.png">, <img src="pic/walk_for_coins.png">?</b><a name="#110" id="110"></a>
<br>
<br>
<b>If the module works, you can remove these badges from your profile and distributions.</b>
<br><br>
We remind you that it is customary on our tracker not only to take, but also to share with other users, based on the simplest principle - "Today you helped someone, tomorrow someone will help you" and therefore, from the moment the tracker began to exist, <a href= "rules.php" class="altlink">rules for preempting Hit&amp;run</a> and <b>since 01/19/2022 anti Hit&amp;Run mod</b> (working in automatic mode and performing checks according to the above rules ).
You have a full <b>2 weeks (14 days)</b> from the moment you complete the download of the giveaway to reach the seeding/ranking requirements of the giveaway. For clarity, in each downloaded and completed (completely downloaded) distribution by you, there will be an icon informing whether you have reached the parameters of the minimum seeding time in relation to the rating on the distribution:<br>
<img src="pic/walk_prohibited.png"> - the required seeding time has not been reached, if the seeding/rating time is not reached within 14 days from the date of download, the system will automatically issue a 2-week warning for Hit&amp;Run;<br>
<img src="pic/walk_possible.png"> - all the rules are fulfilled, if you wish, you can leave the distribution.<br><br>

Also, the possible ones are taken into account: "but I sat / but more in terms of time / rating on another / their distribution / s" - for all users there is an opportunity to leave the distribution earlier than the set time without receiving a warning for Hit&amp;Run:<br >
<img src="pic/walk_for_coins.png"> - by clicking on this icon and paying the required number of coins "Your conscience will be clear and your sleep will be peaceful" =) (this icon is in the description of the torrent you downloaded).<br>

<br>For the <b>VIP</b> class, - if the download starts with this user class, the seeding requirement, even if the class expires, is considered fulfilled.<br>

<center><br><b>!Important!</b></center>
<br>Verification takes place automatically for all completed torrents, starting from 01/09/2018 (for "cunning" users, we also remind you that coins for seeding are not counted on incomplete torrents + no one canceled user profile verification by moderators =) ).<br> <br>
<center><b>Force Majeure:</b></center><br>
if, for example, you turn off the computer at night (or problems with the provider, etc.) - the system does not take into account the time of 12 hours since your last activity when calculating the total seeding time, after this time has elapsed, the module checks whether you continued seeding and if you are absent from the hand, it will continue to sum up the total seeding time further.<br><br>

Given that you have a two-week period (even to achieve the maximum time of 3 days with a zero rating - more than enough), for this reason, any "there was no electricity for a week", "did not sit for 2 hours 31 minutes 15 seconds" and other "arguments" to write Administration is not needed.<br><br>
NB the warning is NOT automatically cleared upon reaching the seeding rules, do not allow it to be received. Frilich does not exempt from the need to seed, but only means what it should: no accounting for downloaded traffic.

<b>I got a warning for Hit&amp;Run, I go to my profile, and there it shows that I can leave. Not fair!!!</b><a name="#116" id="116"></a>
<br>
<br>
In fact, it is not fair to "mow down like a fool", namely, to look at the "little man" symbolizing the possibility of leaving the distribution after receiving a warning (when, of course, it will be shown that it is possible to leave). You need to watch BEFORE LEAVING and by dates, starting from the moment the module was reactivated (for the current time, starting from 01/09/18; previously downloaded torrents can be ignored).

<br>
<br>
Depending on how many coins (seeding bonuses) you have accumulated, your nickname will have a certain highlight. In addition to the aesthetic aspect and highlighting your nickname, highlighting does nothing more. At the moment, the gradation is as follows:<br><br>

<font style="text-shadow: 0 0 1px #fff, 0 0 2px #fff, 0 0 3px #fff, 0 0 4px #fee301, 0 0 5px #fee301, 0 0 6px #fee301, 0 0 7px #fee301 , 0 0 8px #fee301;">"Oligarch of the 1st degree"</font>: at least 30,000,000 on the current account. Freelich cost +20%;<br>

Also, for all users, a TOP rating has been created depending on the number of coins.

<b>How long is a idle/parked account valid for?</b><a name="#115" id="115"></a>
<br>
<br>
Starting from the user classes "Novice" to "Elite user" (inclusive, the rule does not apply to user classes above), the validity period of an unparked account is 120 days. This means that if you do not visit the tracker (do not "seed" distributions, namely, do not "enter the site" after the specified time), your account will be deleted. In case the account is "parked", its validity period will be 240 days. Do not transfer your account in order to save it (and for any other purpose) to third parties - this will inevitably lead to the unconditional deactivation of the account.

<a name="#3" id="3"></a>
<br>
<b>The most common reasons for not updating statistics.</b><a name="#27" id="27"></a>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>User is a cheater. A special version of the client is used with the ability to distribute virtual users to nowhere and dishonestly increase the upload performance (aka "Quick Ban")</li>
<li>The server is overloaded and not responding. Just try to keep the session open until the server is up again. (Flooding the server by periodically manually refreshing the page is not recommended.)</li>
<li>You are using the wrong client. If you want to use the experimental version, use it at your own risk.</li>
<li>In the column "In the distribution" it says that I downloaded / distributed one thing, and in the client - another: this column displays information only for the current session (if you stopped / deleted the distribution, rebooted the computer, etc. - when re-seeding, a new session is created, but in the profile, the data downloaded / uploaded are displayed correctly for all sessions).</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Helpful tips.</b><a name="#28" id="28"></a>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If the torrent you're downloading/sharing doesn't appear in your downloads list, just wait, or refresh the page manually.</li>
<li>Make sure you closed your client properly and the tracker got "event=completed".</li>
<li> If the server has fallen and is lying, do not stop the distribution. If it is raised before you exit the client, the statistics will be updated automatically.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why does the torrent I download/share appear multiple times on my profile?</b><a name="#29" id="29"></a>
<br>
<br>
If for some reason (e.g. an emergency restart of the computer, or a client freeze) your client terminated incorrectly and you restarted it, you will be given a new "peer_id", thus your download will be recognized as a new (different) torrent. And for the old torrent, the server will never receive "event=completed" or "event=stopped", and will display it for some time in the list of your active torrents. Ignore this, eventually the glitch will disappear.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>I ended or canceled a torrent. Why is it still showing up on my profile?</b><a name="#30" id="30"></a>
<br>
<br>
Some clients do not send a message to the server to terminate or cancel the torrent. In such cases, the tracker will wait for a message from your client, and display what you are downloading or distributing for some more time.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why do I sometimes have torrents in my profile that I have never downloaded!?</b><a name="#31" id="31"></a>
<br>
<br>
When a torrent session is started, the tracker uses the passkey to authenticate the user. It is possible that someone stole/recognised your passkey. Be sure to change it in your profile if you suddenly find this. After changing the passkey, you should download all active torrents.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Multiple IPs (Can I login/download from different computers)?</b><a name="#32" id="32"></a>
<br>
<br>
Yes, the tracker supports multiple sessions (up to 3) from different IPs for one user. The torrent is associated with the user at the moment when he starts the download, and only at this moment the IP is important. Thus, if you want to download/share from computer A and computer B using the same account, you need to log in to the site from computer A, start the torrent, and then do the same from computer B. You do not need to log in again when you close the client. Downloading a torrent and / or distributing it from more than 3 IP addresses is prohibited. When downloading torrents with a "lock" from more than 2 IPs (based on 1 seedbox and 1 home), additional keys will be debited.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can NAT/ICS "spoil the raspberries"?</b><a name="#33" id="33"></a>
<br>
<br>
In the case of using NAT, you need to set up different ranges for torrent clients on different computers, and create NAT rules in the router. (Details of configuring routers are beyond the scope of this FAQ, so please refer to the documentation for your device and/or the tech support forum). For errors related to the work behind NAT, the administration is not responsible.

<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is "IOError - [Errno13] Permission denied"?</b><a name="#103" id="103"></a>
<br>
<br>
If you just want to fix this problem - restart your computer, that should help. Curious to read on.

IOError means an I/O error, and it is your system (computer) error, not the tracker. It pops up when the client for some reason cannot open the downloaded files. The most likely reason is 2 clients running at the same time: this can happen, for example, if you closed the client, but in fact it did not close, and continued to work in the background, then you launched a second copy of the client, but the first one is still blocking files, the second one does not can access them and throws you this error.

The most rare case is a violation of the FAT table of your file system, which can lead to unreadable downloaded files. Accordingly, such an error will pop up. (This can happen if you are using FAT. NTFS is a more secure file system and should not cause these errors.)

<h2>My ISP uses a proxy. What should I do? - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>

<br>
<b>What is a proxy?</b><a name="#56" id="56"></a>
<br>
<br>
We can say that it is an intermediary. When you surf the internet, the proxy server receives your request and redirects it to the site you want to connect to. There are several proxy classes (the terminology is far from standard):
<br>
<br>


<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0">

    <td class="embedded" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="embedded" valign="top">Transparent proxies do not require client settings. They work by automatically redirecting traffic from port 80 to the proxy. (Sometimes used as a synonym for non-anonymous proxies.)</td>

    <td class="embedded" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="embedded" valign="top">This type of proxy does not send data over the client to the server (the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header is not sent; and the server does not see your IP.)</td>

    <td class="embedded" width="10">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="embedded" valign="top">The proxy does not send any client information or proxy information to the server (the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, HTTP_VIA, and HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION headers are not sent; the server does not see your IP and does not know that you are using a proxy) .</td>

Transparent proxies may or may not be anonymous. In turn, anonymous proxies have several levels of anonymity.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can I detect that I'm behind a proxy?</b><a name="#57" id="57"></a>
<br>
<br>
Use <a href="http://proxyjudge.org" class="altlink">ProxyJudge</a>. It will give you the HTTP headers that the server received from you. The most important are HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and REMOTE_ADDR.

<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why does it say that I can't connect even though I'm not using NAT/firewall?</b><a name="#105" id="105"></a>
<br>
<br>
Our tracker is quite smart about the issue of determining your real IP, however, it needs the proxy to send the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header. If your provider's proxy does not do this, the following happens: the tracker interprets the proxy's IP as your own. And when you try to access the tracker, it tries to connect to your client to determine if you are behind a NAT/firewall, but in fact it connects to the proxy server on the port that you specified in your client. Because the proxy does not accept anything on this port, the connection will not be established, and the tracker will think that you are behind NAT.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Can I bypass my ISP's proxy?</b><a name="#58" id="58"></a>
<br>
<br>
If your ISP only allows HTTP traffic on port 80, or blocks standard proxy ports, then try <a href="http://www.socks.permeo.com">socks</a> This question goes way beyond this one. FAQ...
<br><br>
<br>
<b>How can I make my torrent client use a proxy?</b><a name="#59" id="59"></a>
<br>
<br>
When you set up a proxy for Internet Explorer, you are actually setting up a proxy for all http traffic (say thanks to Microsoft for having their IE part of the operating system). On the other hand, if you use another browser (Opera/Mozilla/Firefox, etc.) and set up a proxy in it, these settings will only affect this browser. We do not know torrent clients that allow you to set up a proxy only for yourself.

<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why can't I register from a proxy?</b><a name="#60" id="60"></a>
<br>
<br>
We have such rules - we do not allow creating new accounts from under a proxy.

<a name="#8" id="8"></a>
<br>
<b>Maybe my IP is blacklisted?</b><a name="#62" id="62"></a>
<br>
<br>
Our site blocks all IPs listed in the banned users database <a class="altlink" href="http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/">PeerGuardian</a>. This works at the Apache/PHP level and is a regular script that blocks logins from these addresses. Although it does not block low-level protocols, you should try to ping/traceroute. If they do not pass, then the reason is not in the bath.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Your ISP is blocking our website address.</b><a name="#63" id="63"></a>
<br>
<br>
(First of all, it's unlikely that your ISP is doing this. More often than not, DNS servers are to blame, and/or temporary (or permanent :) ) problems with your network/settings). Keep in mind that you will always be shown as not connected because the tracker will not be able to check if your client is accepting incoming connections.
